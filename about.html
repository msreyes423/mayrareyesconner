      <h2>What is Aigoo?</h2>
      <p>Aigoo (or aigo) translates to oh my or OMG from Korean. It is an expression that you'll hear a lot in Kdramas (often comically) when character is stressed, shocked, in pain, tired etc. so I thought it was only fitting to name the site that as well. Trust me you'll have many "aigo" moments yourself as you're watching. Here you'll find Kdrama reviews, news and chatter.</p>
