        <h2>The Show I'm Most Excited For This Season</h2>

        <p>I still consider myself a newbie when it comes to Kdramas since it's been less than 2 years since I first started watching. I have a few shows under my belt but when I meet other Kdrama fans and ask about recommendations they always name so many that I have never seen or even heard of.I tend to stick to the new releases so that way we are on the same playing field. It's new to us both and we both can be equally excited about it. </p>
        <p>The show I have been highly anticipating is <em>While You Were Sleeping</em>. My excitement stems from the two main actors. The shows I love are because of the main actors for the most part so if they starred in other shows I made it my business to watch those as well. I was excited when I noticed Suzy from <em>Uncontrobably Fond</em> was starring in it. It was the second drama I ever watched and my first Korean drama. It was a melodrama and super intense at times so that meant the actors had to dig deep and she definitely did. For me, she was one to watch. So when this show popped up on my radar it was added to my watchlist immediately simply because she was on it. Then I watched the trailer and I really got excited. Not only was Suzy starring in it but so was Lee Jong Suk from <em>W- Two Worlds</em>, one of my recommended shows! The fact that these two are in it tells me this show has got to be a hit but the storyline has me very intrigued as well. I can't wait to start watching.</p>
